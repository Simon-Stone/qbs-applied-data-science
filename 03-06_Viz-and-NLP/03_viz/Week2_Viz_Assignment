# Weekly Assignment for Week 2
## Create a Data Visualization

Assignment: 

Create a data visualization using one or more of Python's visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, plotly. etc.)

Expectations:

1. Data: Find and prepare a dataset of your own choosing (if possible, related to your final project idea you are considering)
2. Organization / Purpose: Organize your Jupyter Notebook around a specific research or methods question and then create a visualization that answers that question. 
    a. a methods question could be something like: On July 3, the world just endured the hottest day on record. However, we experience weather 
    at the local not global level. How can we succinctly visualize daily temperature patterns for Hanover over multiple decades? Can we use such a 
    such a visualization to visually identify local heat waves and cold spells? (see the visualization_weather3.ipynb notebook to see how I answered that.)
3. Format: You will submit your visualization within a Jupyter Notebook that shows the work you did to prepare, filter, re-arrange, and sort your dataset and then create the visualization.
3b. Format - additional option: If you choose to further edit your visualization outside of Jupyter / Python using graphic editing software like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or something similar, you may also a separate image file with your edited, final graphic in addition to your Jupyter notebook.
4. Submission: Push the completed notebook to your new Github page and then share the link to the page with Carly, Jeremy, & Simon 
5. Due Date: Wed. July 12, 2023
