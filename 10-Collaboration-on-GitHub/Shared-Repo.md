# Shared Repository Demo

1. Go to your [GitHub.com](www.github.com) account and create a new repository `penguin-classifier`
2. Add the learners to the repository as collaborators
3. Push the files from `example_project` to the repository's `main` branch
4. Create some TODOs (e.g., "organize folder structure", "add decision tree model", "add classification report") and assign them to the learners
5. Let the learners clone the repo
6. Ask each learner to open a branch to work on their TODO
7. Once they have completed their TODO, ask each learner to merge their changes into main
